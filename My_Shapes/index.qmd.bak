# UTS-4 My SHAPE

> *"Mengering sumurku, terisi kembali, kutemukan makna hidupku di sini."*  
> — Hindia, "Membasuh"

## Pengantar: The Bridge Builder's Blueprint

Ketika orang bertanya "Kamu dari mana?", saya selalu berhenti sejenak—karena jawaban saya bukan satu tempat, tapi sebuah **perjalanan yang membentuk identitas**. Lahir di Jakarta, akar dari Sulawesi, tumbuh di Samarinda, sekolah di Jawa Tengah, kuliah di Jatinangor. Saya adalah **anak perantauan** yang belajar bahwa "home" bukan tempat, tapi **orang-orang dan nilai-nilai yang kita bawa ke mana pun kita pergi**.

Dokumen ini adalah **blueprint** dari siapa saya hari ini—disintesis dari pengalaman merantau, kegagalan yang mengajarkan, komunitas yang membentuk, dan nilai yang mengarahkan. Ini bukan CV. Ini adalah **peta diri** untuk memandu ke mana saya melangkah selanjutnya.

### **H — Heart (Passion & Values)**

**What I Care About Deeply:**

1. **Inclusive Technology:**  
   Teknologi yang tidak hanya "work" tapi **accessible dan empowering untuk everyone**, especially those who feel left out. Backend systems yang robust tapi dokumentasinya clear untuk junior developers.

2. **Community for the "Outsiders":**  
   Creating spaces di mana orang yang merasa "tidak belong" bisa menemukan tribe mereka. Karena saya tahu rasanya being the new person—dan saya tahu betapa powerful-nya when someone reaches out.

3. **Vulnerable Leadership:**  
   Leadership yang tidak pura-pura perfect. Sharing struggles, acknowledging when you don't know, creating culture di mana "it's okay to not be okay"—because that's when genuine growth happens.

4. **Education Through Stories:**  
   Pembelajaran yang bukan hanya transfer knowledge, tapi **transfer wisdom through lived experience**. Stories connect deeper than theories.

5. **Building for Long-Term Impact:**  
   Bukan cuma "solve immediate problem," tapi **build systems and culture yang sustainable**—yang people bisa maintain even after I'm gone.

**Core Values:**

- **"Memberi walau mengering":** Giving even when you feel empty—because paradoxically, that's what refills you
- **"Home is what you build":** Not waiting for belonging, but actively creating it
- **"Collecting stories over trophies":** Process and people over mere achievements
- **"Bridge, not root":** Connecting what's separate, rather than being stuck in one place
- **"Vulnerable is powerful":** Honesty about imperfection creates deeper connection than perfection

**Problems I Want to Solve:**

- **Technical debt yang bikin junior developers overwhelmed** (better documentation, clearer architecture)
- **Culture yang toxic karena everyone pretends to be perfect** (normalize struggle, create psychological safety)
- **Outsiders yang merasa alone** (proactive bridge-building, inclusive communities)
- **Systems yang collapse under pressure** (resilient infrastructure, backup plans, calm crisis management)

### **E — Experiences (What Shaped Me)**

**Chapter 1: Samarinda (Balita - SMP) — Roots & First Confidence**

- **What happened:** Grew up in comfort zone, won lomba fisika, felt "safe"
- **What I learned:** Comfort can become limitation; confidence from small wins builds foundation for bigger risks
- **How it shaped me:** Gave me baseline confidence to say "yes" to bigger challenges later

**Chapter 2: Jawa Tengah SMA (3 Years) — The Crucible**

**Year 1 - "Mengering":**
- **What happened:** Beasiswa penuh, asrama boarding school, completely alien environment. Homesick, culture shock, language barrier, loneliness. Lowest point: wanting to quit.
- **Critical moment:** Mama's words—"Selesaikan yang sudah dimulai. Jangan menyerah sebelum berperang."
- **What I learned:** Loneliness is temporary transition phase, not permanent state. "Mengering" is part of cycle, not failure.
- **How it shaped me:** Built resilience core—"If I survived that, I can survive anything."

**Year 2 - "Terisi Kembali":**
- **What happened:** Menang lomba komputer (first win in new environment), found circle of fellow "outsiders," started building "home"
- **What I learned:** Winning matters less than process of connecting. Your tribe finds you when you stop trying to fit into others' tribes.
- **How it shaped me:** Learned to build community proactively, not wait for it to happen

**Year 3 - Consolidation:**
- **What happened:** Felt like I belonged, but not attached—ready for next chapter
- **What I learned:** "Home" is portable—you carry it in skills, values, and connections
- **How it shaped me:** Prepared me to repeat the cycle at ITB with more confidence

**Chapter 3: ITB Jatinangor (Semester 1-5) — From Survivor to Builder**

**Semester 1-2 - Pattern Recognition:**
- **What happened:** Arrived, recognized "oh no here we go again" feeling, but this time with playbook
- **What I learned:** Adaptation gets easier each time—not because it's less hard, but because you trust the process
- **How it shaped me:** Joined organizations immediately (KM ITB, HMIF), said yes to opportunities faster

**Semester 3-4 - Rising to Leadership:**
- **What happened:** Given leadership roles (Wakil Ketua Back-End HMIF, Dirjen Back-End KM ITB)
- **What I learned:** Leadership is about empowering others to grow, not having all answers
- **How it shaped me:** Developed mentorship approach based on shared struggle, not superiority

**Semester 5 - Integration & Giving Back:**
- **What happened:** Ketua IT Parade Wisuda Oktober 2025—system crisis, H-1 panic, team leadership under pressure
- **Critical moment:** System failed H-7, had to rebuild/pivot. Chose vulnerable leadership—"sistem kita gagal, tapi kita solve together"
- **What I learned:** 
  - Perfection is myth; "good enough + great team adaptability" beats perfect system with no backup
  - Honest admission of problems builds trust more than fake confidence
  - Crisis reveals who you really are as leader
- **How it shaped me:** Solidified belief in vulnerable, inclusive leadership style

**Parallel Experience - Helping Junior Papua:**
- **What happened:** Junior dari Papua approached me, struggling with same issues I faced year 1 Jawa Tengah
- **What I did:** Shared my story, validated his struggle, gave practical tips, stayed available
- **What he said:** "Mas jadi bridge waktu gue belum nemu tempat"
- **What I learned:** Your mess (past struggles) becomes your message (tool to help others)
- **How it shaped me:** Confirmed my "calling"—being bridge for people who feel like outsiders

**The Meta-Pattern:**
Every transition follows cycle: **Mengering (struggle) → Memberi walau mengering (give despite emptiness) → Terisi kembali (refilled through giving) → Temukan makna (find meaning in the cycle)**

---

## My Personal Charter: The Bridge Builder's Manifesto

### **Mission Statement**

To build **inclusive, resilient systems and communities** where people—especially those who feel like outsiders—can find belonging, grow their capabilities, and pay it forward to others. To lead with **vulnerability, technical excellence, and deep empathy**, creating spaces where "it's okay to not be okay" becomes the foundation for genuine growth.

### **Core Values (Non-Negotiables)**

1. **"Memberi walau mengering"** — Give even when you feel empty, because that's what refills you
2. **Vulnerability is strength** — Honesty about struggle creates deeper connection than pretense of perfection
3. **Collect stories, not trophies** — Process and people matter more than mere achievements
4. **Build bridges, not walls** — Connect what's separate; create belonging where there was isolation
5. **Long-term sustainability over short-term wins** — Build systems and cultures that outlast you
6. **Inclusive by default** — Actively seek and amplify voices that might be overlooked

### **Roles I'm Called To**

- **Bridge Builder:** Connecting people who feel like outsiders, creating communities from scattered individuals
- **Vulnerable Leader:** Leading not from position of "having arrived" but from "we're learning together"
- **Backend Architect:** Building robust, well-documented systems that empower others to build on top
- **Story-Weaver:** Sharing struggles to give others courage; turning mess into message

### **Decision-Making Compass**

When faced with choices, I ask:

1. **Does this include or exclude?** (Prioritize inclusive options)
2. **Am I being honest about my capacity?** (Boundaries protect sustainability)
3. **Does this build capability in others, or just in me?** (Empowerment > personal achievement)
4. **What would "past me" who was struggling need right now?** (Empathy guide)
5. **Will this matter in 5 years, or just tomorrow?** (Long-term orientation)

### **My Promises (Operating Principles)**

**To Myself:**
- Acknowledge when I'm "mengering" instead of pretending I'm full
- Set boundaries without guilt—"I can help, but not perfectly" is valid
- Trust the cycle—mengering is temporary, terisi kembali will come
- Keep collecting stories; they're my most valuable asset

**To My Teams:**
- Create psychological safety: normalize struggle, mistakes, and "I don't know"
- Be honest when systems fail—vulnerability builds trust
- Give people tools and trust, not micromanagement
- Distribute credit widely; hoard responsibility lightly

**To "Outsiders" (Fellow Merantau):**
- Reach out proactively when I see someone struggling
- Share my story without sugarcoating—the real version with the crying-to-Mama moment
- Be the bridge I wished I had in year 1 Jawa Tengah
- Remind them: loneliness is temporary, you're stronger than you think

**To Technical Systems:**
- Document like someone who's lost will read it
- Build backup plans before crisis hits
- Make it easier for the next person to maintain/improve
- Accessibility and clarity are not optional

### **Boundaries (What I Say No To)**

- Projects that require pretending I have all answers when I don't
- Environments that punish vulnerability or normalize toxic overwork
- Systems that exclude people without good reason
- Short-term "wins" that burn people out for metrics

### **Success Metrics (How I'll Know I'm Living This)**

- People feel safe admitting struggles around me
- "Outsiders" find belonging in communities I help build
- Systems I build are maintainable by others after I leave
- Stories I share give courage to people facing similar challenges
- Teams I lead are resilient, not just efficient

## Elevator Pitch (90 Seconds)

"Hi, I'm Andi Farhan Hidayat—semester 5 Teknik Informatika ITB, currently Ketua IT Parade Wisuda Oktober 2025, Dirjen Back-End KM ITB, dan Wakil Ketua Back-End HMIF ITB.

But those titles don't capture who I really am. I'm a **bridge builder**—someone who's been the new person in multiple cities (Samarinda, Jawa Tengah, Jatinangor) and learned that 'home' isn't a place you find, it's something you **build through connection**.

My technical strength is backend engineering—building robust systems, managing crises calmly, creating infrastructure that others can build on. But my real strength? **Vulnerable leadership**. I lead not from position of having all answers, but from honesty about struggle—because that's what creates psychological safety where real growth happens.

I care deeply about **inclusive technology** and **communities for the 'outsiders'**—people who feel like they don't belong. I've been there. And I know how powerful it is when someone reaches out.

My philosophy? **'Memberi walau mengering'**—giving even when you feel empty. Because paradoxically, that's what refills you. I'd rather collect stories and build bridges than collect trophies and stand alone.

If you're building something that values people over perfection, inclusion over exclusion, and long-term sustainability over short-term wins—let's talk. I'm always looking for communities where vulnerability is strength and 'outsiders' become family."

## Final Reflection: The Continuous Cycle

Looking at my SHAPE—my **Strengths, Heart, Abilities, Personality, and Experiences**—I see a clear pattern:

**I am most alive when I'm building bridges for people who feel like outsiders.**

Not because I've "arrived" or "have all answers," but precisely because **I'm still in the process**. I'm still adapting, still learning, still occasionally "mengering." And that's exactly what makes me credible when I reach out to others who are struggling.

The cycle continues:
- **Mengering:** Every new challenge, every new environment, every moment of self-doubt
- **Memberi walau mengering:** Leading despite uncertainty, documenting while still learning, mentoring while still being mentored
- **Terisi kembali:** Finding that giving somehow refills; connection somehow heals loneliness
- **Temukan makna:** Realizing this cycle IS the point, not something to overcome

**My SHAPE isn't fixed—it's evolving.** Every person I connect with, every system I build, every story I share adds to it. And every time I choose vulnerability over perfection, inclusion over exclusion, long-term over short-term, I'm living into the person this SHAPE describes.

**To future me reading this:** Remember, your greatest strength isn't that you never "mengering"—it's that you know how to navigate the cycle. Keep building bridges. Keep being honest. Keep collecting stories. Keep giving even when you feel empty.

Because you've learned: **that's exactly how you get filled back up.**

*"Mengering sumurku, terisi kembali, kutemukan makna hidupku di sini."*

— Hindia, "Membasuh" (and Andi Farhan Hidayat's life anthem)

---

## Legacy Note: What I Want to Be Remembered For

Not for the systems I built (though I hope they're useful).  
Not for the titles I held (though I'm grateful for the trust).  
Not for being the smartest or most accomplished (I'm neither).

**I want to be remembered as someone who made "outsiders" feel like they had a home.**

Someone who proved that **vulnerability creates stronger teams than perfection ever could.**

Someone whose mess became a message that gave others courage to keep going.

If even one person reads my story and thinks, "If he survived year 1 Jawa Tengah, I can survive this"—then this SHAPE document, this journey, this whole "collecting stories not trophies" philosophy?

**Worth it.**

## Narasi Diri (versi panjang, 3–5 paragraf)

**Kini.** Saya mengabdikan diri sebagai insinyur-pendidik yang merancang pengalaman belajar dan sistem cerdas agar manusia bertumbuh utuh: cakap teknis, peka nurani, dan gembira belajar. Kekuatan saya—spiritualitas, kreativitas, suka belajar, keingintahuan, perspektif, keadilan, dan kepemimpinan—mengarahkan cara saya memimpin, mengajar, dan menulis. 

**Dulu—titik balik.** Saya belajar bahwa langkah kecil yang konsisten mengalahkan rintangan besar: berjalan sendirian dalam dingin—secara harfiah dan metaforis—membentuk ketahanan batin. Di laboratorium, saya menuntaskan perangkat lunak **speech compression** dalam waktu singkat dan merancang **control unit** berbasis FPGA, lalu menulis paper pertama—momen yang mengajarkan disiplin, standar mutu, dan keberanian intelektual. ([Armein Z. R. Langi in the City of Eden][3])

**Nilai yang saya pegang.** Saya memilih **kebaikan** di atas sekadar **kepintaran**, menempatkan **empati** sebagai kecerdasan tertinggi, dan mengejar **kebenaran sebagai realitas yang sesungguhnya**. Keluarga besar meneguhkan panggilan itu—rumah sebagai laboratorium kasih dan keadilan. ([Armein Z. R. Langi in the City of Eden][6])
